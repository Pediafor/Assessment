## 📖 Overview & Philosophy 🧠

The **Pediafor Assessment & Evaluation** application is the first product wedge in our mission to build **open, AI-centric education infrastructure**. It aims to solve one of the most critical gaps in education today: providing a robust, fair, and accessible assessment platform that isn't locked behind high costs or proprietary systems.

Our approach and **core principles** define the project's direction:

* **AI-Driven**: We are designing a platform to integrate Artificial Intelligence from the ground up for features like automated grading, intelligent feedback, and adaptive testing.
* **Open Infrastructure**: The core framework is designed to be extensible and interoperable, allowing institutions to integrate with their existing tools (LMS, SIS). By being open-source, we ensure the platform can evolve with community needs.
* **Equitable**: By building in the open and focusing on efficiency, we aim to make powerful education technology accessible to schools and institutions of all sizes, regardless of their budget.
* **Fast & Secure**: Designed with low-latency microservices, token-based security (**Paseto**), and efficient, asynchronous workflows.
