## Service Overview

The Submission Service is a core microservice in the Pediafor Assessment Platform responsible for managing the complete student submission lifecycle. It handles everything from initial submission creation through answer management to final submission for grading.

### 🎯 Primary Responsibilities
- **Submission Management**: CRUD operations for student submissions with status tracking
- **Answer Management**: Flexible JSON-based answer storage supporting all question types
- **Workflow Management**: Draft → Submit → Grade pipeline with status validation
- **Autosave Functionality**: Real-time saving of student answers as they work
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions ensuring students can only access their own submissions
- **File Attachments**: Support for submission attachments with validation and metadata

```

### 🔄 Service Dependencies

#### Upstream Dependencies
- **Gateway Service**: Authentication and request routing
- **User Service**: User context and authentication validation
- **Assessment Service**: Question data and assessment metadata

#### Downstream Dependencies
- **Grading Service**: Receives submissions for automated scoring (planned)
- **Analytics Service**: Submission statistics and performance data (planned)

---

## Architecture & Design

### Domain Model

The Submission Service implements the following core domain entities:

```typescript
// Core submission entity
Submission {
  id: string
  userId: string          // Student owner
  assessmentId: string    // Assessment being submitted for
  answers: JSON          // Flexible answer storage
  status: SubmissionStatus
  score?: number         // Final score (set by grading)
  submittedAt?: Date    // Submission timestamp
  // ... metadata fields
}

// Submission lifecycle states
enum SubmissionStatus {
  DRAFT      // Student working on submission
  SUBMITTED  // Student has submitted for grading
  GRADING    // Currently being graded
  GRADED     // Grading complete
  RETURNED   // Returned to student for revision
}
```

### Service Boundaries

The Submission Service maintains clear boundaries with other services:

- **Assessment Data**: Read-only access to question metadata via API calls
- **User Context**: Receives authenticated user information from Gateway
- **Grading Integration**: Provides submission data to grading service
- **File Management**: Handles submission attachments independently

### Data Flow Architecture

```
1. Student Request → Gateway Service (Authentication)
2. Gateway → Submission Service (User Context + Request)
3. Submission Service → Database (Data Operations)
4. Submission Service → Assessment Service (Question Validation)
5. Submission Service → Gateway → Student (Response)
```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### Submissions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Submission" (
  "id"           TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  "userId"       TEXT NOT NULL,
  "assessmentId" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "answers"      JSONB,
  "status"       "SubmissionStatus" DEFAULT 'DRAFT',
  "score"        DOUBLE PRECISION,
  "maxScore"     DOUBLE PRECISION,
  "submittedAt"  TIMESTAMP,
  "createdAt"    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt"    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  
  CONSTRAINT "Submission_userId_assessmentId_unique" UNIQUE("userId", "assessmentId")
);

CREATE INDEX "Submission_userId_idx" ON "Submission"("userId");
CREATE INDEX "Submission_assessmentId_idx" ON "Submission"("assessmentId");
CREATE INDEX "Submission_status_idx" ON "Submission"("status");
```

#### Submission Files Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE "SubmissionFile" (
  "id"           TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  "submissionId" TEXT REFERENCES "Submission"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "fileName"     TEXT NOT NULL,
  "filePath"     TEXT NOT NULL,
  "fileSize"     INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "mimeType"     TEXT NOT NULL,
  "uploadedAt"   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX "SubmissionFile_submissionId_idx" ON "SubmissionFile"("submissionId");
```

#### Grades Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Grade" (
  "id"           TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  "submissionId" TEXT UNIQUE REFERENCES "Submission"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "totalScore"   DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  "maxScore"     DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  "percentage"   DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  "feedback"     TEXT,
  "gradedBy"     TEXT,
  "gradedAt"     TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Answer Storage Schema

The `answers` field uses JSONB for flexible storage of different question types:

```json
{
  "question1": "Simple text answer",
  "question2": ["option1", "option3"],  // Multiple choice
  "question3": {
    "type": "essay",
    "content": "Long form essay response...",
    "wordCount": 245
  },
  "question4": {
    "type": "file_upload",
    "fileIds": ["file-123", "file-456"],
    "description": "Uploaded solution files"
  }
}
```

## Submission Workflow

### Student Submission Process

```
1. Assessment Assignment
   ↓
2. Create Submission (DRAFT)
   ↓
3. Answer Questions (with autosave)
   ↓
4. Submit for Grading (SUBMITTED)
   ↓
5. Automated Grading (GRADING)
   ↓
6. Grade Complete (GRADED)
   ↓
7. Results Available to Student
```

### Status Transitions

```typescript
// Valid status transitions
const VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
  DRAFT: ['SUBMITTED'],
  SUBMITTED: ['GRADING', 'RETURNED'],
  GRADING: ['GRADED', 'RETURNED'],
  GRADED: ['RETURNED'],
  RETURNED: ['SUBMITTED']
};
```

### Business Rules

#### Student Permissions
- Can create submissions for assigned assessments
- Can modify answers only in DRAFT status
- Can submit once per assessment (unique constraint)
- Cannot change status directly (except DRAFT → SUBMITTED)

#### Teacher Permissions
- Can view all submissions for their assessments
- Can update scores and add feedback
- Can change status for grading workflow
- Cannot modify student answers

#### Admin Permissions
- Full access to all submission operations
- Can delete submissions if needed
- Can override business rules when necessary

---

## Security & Authorization

### Authentication Integration

The service integrates with the platform's PASETO-based authentication:

```typescript
// User context from Gateway Service
interface UserContext {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'STUDENT' | 'TEACHER' | 'ADMIN';
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}
```

### Authorization Matrix

| Operation | Student | Teacher | Admin |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Create Submission | Own only | ❌ | ✅ |
| Read Submission | Own only | All for their assessments | All |
| Update Answers | Own DRAFT only | ❌ | ✅ |
| Update Score/Status | ❌ | All for their assessments | All |
| Submit for Grading | Own DRAFT only | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delete Submission | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| View Statistics | ❌ | All for their assessments | All |

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: All requests validated using express-validator
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with ownership validation
- **Audit Logging**: All operations logged with user context
- **Data Encryption**: Database encryption at rest and in transit

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage: 76 Total Tests (66 Passing, 87% Success Rate)

#### Test Distribution
- **Unit Tests**: 19 tests - Core business logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: 41 tests - API endpoint validation with authentication
- **Middleware Tests**: 16 tests - Authentication and validation middleware

#### Test Categories

**Unit Tests (submission.service.test.ts)**
- Submission CRUD operations
- Answer management logic
- Status transition validation
- Access control enforcement
- Business rule validation

**Integration Tests (submission.routes.test.ts)**

### Test Infrastructure

```typescript
// Test setup with database cleanup
beforeEach(async () => {
  await prisma.submissionFile.deleteMany({});
  await prisma.grade.deleteMany({});
  await prisma.submission.deleteMany({});
});

// Comprehensive test data
const mockStudent: UserContext = {
  id: 'student-123',
  email: 'student@test.com',
  role: 'STUDENT',
  firstName: 'Test',
  lastName: 'Student'
};
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test files
npm test -- submission.service.test.ts
npm test -- submission.routes.test.ts
npm test -- middleware.test.ts

# Run with watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Known Test Issues (10 failing tests)

Current test failures are related to:
1. **Database cleanup**: Some tests failing due to record conflicts between runs
2. **Integration timeouts**: Occasional timeout issues in HTTP tests  
3. **Test isolation**: Minor issues with test data isolation

These are infrastructure issues, not core business logic problems.
