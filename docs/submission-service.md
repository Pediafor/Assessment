---

## Architecture & Design

### Domain Model

The Submission Service implements the following core domain entities:

```typescript
// Core submission entity
Submission {
  id: string
  userId: string          // Student owner
  assessmentId: string    // Assessment being submitted for
  answers: JSON          // Flexible answer storage
  status: SubmissionStatus
  score?: number         // Final score (set by grading)
  submittedAt?: Date    // Submission timestamp
  // ... metadata fields
}

// Submission lifecycle states
enum SubmissionStatus {
  DRAFT      // Student working on submission
  SUBMITTED  // Student has submitted for grading
  GRADING    // Currently being graded
  GRADED     // Grading complete
  RETURNED   // Returned to student for revision
}
```

### Service Boundaries

The Submission Service maintains clear boundaries with other services:

- **Assessment Data**: Read-only access to question metadata via API calls
- **User Context**: Receives authenticated user information from Gateway
- **Grading Integration**: Provides submission data to grading service
- **File Management**: Handles submission attachments independently

### Data Flow Architecture

```
1. Student Request → Gateway Service (Authentication)
2. Gateway → Submission Service (User Context + Request)
3. Submission Service → Database (Data Operations)
4. Submission Service → Assessment Service (Question Validation)
5. Submission Service → Gateway → Student (Response)
```

---

## Event-Driven Features

The Submission Service is fully integrated with the platform's event-driven architecture, publishing real-time events for cross-service coordination and analytics.

### **Event Publishing**

#### **Submission Lifecycle Events**
```typescript
// Published when submission is created
interface SubmissionSubmittedEvent {
  type: 'submission.submitted';
  submissionId: string;
  assessmentId: string;
  studentId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Published when submission receives grading
interface SubmissionGradedEvent {
  type: 'submission.graded';
  submissionId: string;
  assessmentId: string;
  score: number;
  maxScore: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

#### **Event Publishing Implementation**
```typescript
// services/submission.service.ts
export class SubmissionService {
  async createSubmission(data: CreateSubmissionRequest): Promise<Submission> {
    const submission = await this.repository.create(data);
    
    // Publish event for real-time analytics
    await publishEvent('submission.submitted', {
      submissionId: submission.id,
      assessmentId: submission.assessmentId,
      studentId: submission.studentId,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    return submission;
  }

  async finalizeSubmission(submissionId: string): Promise<Submission> {
    const submission = await this.repository.finalizeSubmission(submissionId);
    
    // Trigger grading workflow
    await publishEvent('submission.ready_for_grading', {
      submissionId: submission.id,
      assessmentId: submission.assessmentId,
      studentId: submission.studentId,
      answers: submission.answers,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    return submission;
  }
}
```

### **Cross-Service Integration**

#### **Real-Time Assessment Updates**
- **Assessment Service** subscribes to `submission.submitted` events
- Automatically updates assessment statistics and analytics
- Enables real-time instructor dashboards

#### **Grading Service Coordination**
- Publishes `submission.ready_for_grading` events
- Coordinates with automated grading workflows
- Receives grading completion notifications

### **Event Configuration**
```typescript
// config/rabbitmq.ts
const SUBMISSION_EVENTS = {
  SUBMITTED: 'submission.submitted',
  GRADED: 'submission.graded',
  READY_FOR_GRADING: 'submission.ready_for_grading',
  FILE_UPLOADED: 'submission.file_uploaded'
};

export const initializeEventPublisher = async () => {
  await assertExchange('pediafor.events', 'topic', { durable: true });
  logger.info('Submission service event publisher initialized');
};
```

### **Event Testing**
```typescript
// tests/events/publishing.test.ts
describe('Submission Event Publishing', () => {
  it('publishes submission.submitted when submission created', async () => {
    const submission = await submissionService.createSubmission(mockData);
    
    expect(mockPublishEvent).toHaveBeenCalledWith('submission.submitted', {
      submissionId: submission.id,
      assessmentId: mockData.assessmentId,
      studentId: mockData.studentId,
      timestamp: expect.any(Date)
    });
  });
});
```
