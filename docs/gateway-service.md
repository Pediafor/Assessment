## Overview

The Gateway Service serves as the **single entry point** for all client applications accessing the Pediafor Assessment Platform. It implements a comprehensive API Gateway pattern with advanced authentication, routing, and security features.

### **Core Responsibilities**

- üîê **Authentication Gateway**: PASETO V4 token validation and user context management
- üîÑ **Service Discovery**: Intelligent routing to backend microservices
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Layer**: Rate limiting, CORS, input validation, and threat protection
- üìä **Health Monitoring**: Aggregated health checks across all services

---

## Architecture

The gateway sits between the client applications and the backend microservices, providing a unified interface to the platform.

---

## Authentication System

The Gateway Service uses **PASETO V4** for token-based authentication. It verifies the token from the `Authorization` header and, if valid, injects user information into the request headers for downstream services.

### **User Context Headers**
```http
X-User-ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
X-User-Role: TEACHER
X-User-Email: teacher@example.com
```

---

## Service Routing

The Gateway Service routes requests to the appropriate backend microservice based on the URL path.

- `/api/auth/*` ‚Üí **User Service**
- `/api/users/*` ‚Üí **User Service**
- `/api/assessments/*` ‚Üí **Assessment Service**
- `/api/submissions/*` ‚Üí **Submission Service**
- `/api/grading/*` ‚Üí **Grading Service**

---

## Real-time Service

The gateway also includes a real-time service that runs on a separate port (defaulting to 8080) and provides WebSocket and WebTransport capabilities. This service is used for pushing real-time updates to clients.

---

## Security Features

- **Helmet**: For setting various HTTP headers to secure the app.
- **CORS**: To control cross-origin requests.
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse.

---

## API Documentation

### Gateway Endpoints

- `GET /`: Returns information about the gateway service.
- `GET /health`: Provides a health check of the gateway service.

### Proxied Routes

The gateway proxies requests to the following services:

- **User Service**: Handles all requests to `/api/auth` and `/api/users`.
- **Assessment Service**: Handles all requests to `/api/assessments`.
- **Submission Service**: Handles all requests to `/api/submissions`.
- **Grading Service**: Handles all requests to `/api/grading`.
