# Event-Driven Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Pediafor Assessment Platform implements a comprehensive event-driven architecture using RabbitMQ as the message broker. This enables real-time communication between microservices and automatic processing of assessment workflows.

## Architecture Components

### Message Broker
- **RabbitMQ**: Central message broker for event distribution
- **Port**: 5672 (AMQP), 15672 (Management UI)
- **Exchanges**: Topic-based routing for flexible event distribution
- **Queues**: Durable queues with dead-letter handling

### Event Publishers
- **User Service**: Publishes user lifecycle events.
- **Assessment Service**: Publishes assessment lifecycle events.
- **Submission Service**: Publishes submission lifecycle events.
- **Grading Service**: Publishes grading result events.

### Event Subscribers
- **Assessment Service**: Consumes submission, grading, and user events for analytics and statistics.
- **Grading Service**: Consumes submission events to trigger auto-grading.
- **Gateway Service**: Consumes all events to push real-time updates to clients via WebSockets.
 - **Notification Service**: Consumes `grading.completed` to send email notifications to students.
